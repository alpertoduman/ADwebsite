The other dynamic will be based on the saving decision.\n\\[\n\\frac{dK}{dt} + \\frac{dp}{dt}T = s(F_{k}K - \\mu K  + \\frac{dp}{dt}T)\n\\]\nInserting the first equation into the second and using the normalization that \\(T=1\\) we can get\n\\[\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = (sK - (1-s)p)(F_{k}-\\mu)\n\\]\nSteady solutions loci will be \\(F_{k} = \\mu\\) and \\(p = sK/(1-s)\\)\nDefining \\(K^{*}\\) as the capital solving \\(F_{k} = \\mu\\) we can get a stability for any \\(p\\) as \\(K=K^{*}\\). Similarly define \\(p^{*} = sK/(1-s)\\).\n\\(K^{*}\\) in any combination with \\(p < p^{*}\\) is a stable equilibrium and any $ pp^{*}$ an unstable equilibrium.\nThe most interesting observation is that if \\(K < K^{*}\\) and the initial price is too high, the economy experiences a bubble."
