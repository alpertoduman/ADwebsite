## Returns

In  a capitalist economy the fundamental asset is supposed to be productive (ie. machinery and equipment, software/hardware) capital. However, the observed stocks of assets tell a different story. Productive capital is just less than one quarter of total wealth in the advanced countries, and probably less so in the developing countries.

A potential, though a partial, explanation is the lifetime of the productive capital being a lot less than the dwellings and other assets.
