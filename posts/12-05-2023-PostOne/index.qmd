We will jumpstart with a discussion of an interesting model by Stiglitz (2015).
Assume that land is a store of wealth and is fixed.
Then the long-term equilibrium condition in an economy with CRS production function that has capital and labor will be

$$
\frac{dp (log p)}{dt} = (F_{k}-\mu)
$$
simply stating that the return on land should be equal to the return on capital. 
The other dynamic will be based on the saving decision. 

$$
\frac{dK}{dt} + \frac{dp}{dt}T = s(F_{k}K - \mu K  + \frac{dp}{dt}T)
$$


Inserting the first equation into the second and using the normalization that $T=1$ we can get

$$
\frac{dK}{dt} = (sK - (1-s)p)(F_{k}-\mu)
$$

Steady solutions loci will be $F_{k} = \mu$ and $p = sK/(1-s)$

Defining $K^{*}$ as the capital solving $F_{k} = \mu$ we can get a stability for any $p$ as $K=K^{*}$.
Similarly define $p^{*} = sK/(1-s)$. 

$K=K^{*}$ in any combination with $p < p^{*}$ is a stable equilibrium and any $p\geq p^{*}$ an unstable equilibrium.

The most interesting observation is that if $K < K^{*}$ and the initial price is too high, the economy experiences a bubble.
