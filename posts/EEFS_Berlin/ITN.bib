@article{ANAS2003258,
	abstract = {The industrial diversification of cities is explained without imposing linkages among industries. In each of two city-industries, a manufacture is produced competitively as the final good using labor and industry-specific differentiated services. Manufacturers import the services of their industry from all cities that produce them, since their technology favors variety. In specialized cities, the city-industry is large and many services are locally available but the two manufactures have to be traded among cities. In diversified cities, the two manufactures are produced in the same city, and each industry crowds out half the local services of the other, but manufactures need not be imported. A lower cost of trading manufactures (e.g., railroads and intercity highways) favors a system of specialized cities, while a lower cost of trading services (e.g., telephone, the Internet) favors a system of diversified cities since the latter cities rely more on imported services, having fewer locally. A larger cost-share of services favors specialization, and high intra-city commuting cost and population growth favor diversification.},

@article{BATTISTON20072061,
	abstract = {We present a simple model of a production network in which firms are linked by supplier--customer relationships involving extension of trade--credit. Our aim is to identify the minimal set of mechanisms which reproduce qualitatively the main stylized facts of industrial demography, such as firms' size distribution, and, at the same time, the correlation, over time and across firms, of output, growth and bankruptcies. The behavior of aggregate variables can be traced back to the direct firm--firm interdependence. In this paper, we assume that the number of firms is constant and the network has a periodic static structure. But the framework allows further extensions to investigate which network structures are more robust against domino effects and, if the network is let to evolve in time, which structures emerge spontaneously, depending on the individual strategies for orders and delivery.},

@article{Inoue:2019aa,
	abstract = {Social and economic networks can be a channel of negative shocks and thus deteriorate resilience and sustainability in societies. This study focuses on supply chains, or supplier--customer networks of firms and examines how these supply chains enable production losses caused by natural disasters to propagate and persist in regions not directly affected by the disaster. We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6{\%} of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5{\%}). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.},

@article{HENRIET2012150,
	abstract = {This article proposes a theoretical framework to investigate economic robustness to exogenous shocks such as natural disasters. It is based on a dynamic model that represents a regional economy as a network of production units through the disaggregation of sector-scale input--output tables. Results suggest that disaster-related output losses depend on direct losses heterogeneity and on the economic network structure. Two aggregate indexes -- concentration and clustering -- appear as important drivers of economic robustness, offering opportunities for robustness-enhancing strategies. Modern industrial organization seems to reduce short-term robustness in a trade-off against higher efficiency in normal times.},

@article{TOKUI201759,
	abstract = {The Great East-Japan Earthquake of March 11th, 2011 had a serious negative economic impact on the Japanese economy. The earthquake substantially reduced production not only in regions directly hit by the earthquake but also in other parts of Japan through supply chain disruptions. We examine the economic impact of the supply chain disruptions immediately following the earthquake using a unique interregional input-output table combining two different regional IO tables, the JIP database, and other regional statistics. To conduct our analysis, we modify the forward linkage methodology to take into account the bottleneck effect in the intermediate input of manufacturing production. Our estimates show that the production losses caused by the supply chain disruptions would amount to at least 0.35% of the country's GDP. We also analyzed how establishing multiple supply chains would work to mitigate the damage of potential natural disasters in the future. However, as multiple supply chains may lose production efficiency at the firm level, we would require policies that provide incentives to firms that diversify supply chains.},
